#Mapping Texts

##Experiments in Entity Extraction and Geocoding

This project explores the use of the [Alchemy API](http://www.alchemyapi.com/), a natural language processing service, to extract entities from public domain texts at the Internet Archive (and elsewhere) and to display those entities on maps using [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/).
Code samples have been written in XQuery and tested in [BaseX](http://basex.org/).

This project was developed as part of a presentation with Lindsey Langsdon at [THATCamp Vanderbilt 2013](http://vanderbilt2013.thatcamp.org/).
